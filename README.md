Place the target anywhere on the canvas, and capture as many balls as possible. At any given level, you need to capture a minimum number of balls in order to advance to the next level.

The score increment starts with 10, and increases by a multiple of 10 with each successive collision. The larger the chain reaction you create, the more points you score!
