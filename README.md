Place the target anywhere on the canvas, and capture as many balls as possible. At any given level, you need to capture a minimum number of balls in order to advance to the next level.

The score increment starts with 10, and increases by a multiple of 10 with each successive collision. The larger the chain reaction you create, the more points you score!

## Planning and Development
Agile development methodologies, namely creating user stories and designing wireframes, were used in this project. Please refer to [here](https://github.com/aletheatoh/chain-reaction/blob/master/agile-dev/agiledev.md) for a detailed description of my agile development process. 

## Built with
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Features
### Responsive Design
<p>This game is designed to be mobile and tablet-friendly.</p>
<p>However, please note that the difficulty level of the game is relatively higher on mobile and tablet devices due to the larger size of the canvas playing area.</p>
<p>I am currently working on improving the responsive design for mobile devices.</p>

### Unresolved Problems
- Audio features do not properly load on mobile devices.
