## Features
### Responsive Design
<p>This game was designed to be mobile and tablet-friendly. However, please note that the difficulty level of the game is relatively higher on mobile and tablet devices due to the larger size of the canvas playing area.</p>

Place the target anywhere on the canvas, and capture as many balls as possible. At any given level, you need to capture a minimum number of balls in order to advance to the next level.

The score increment starts with 10, and increases by a multiple of 10 with each successive collision. The larger the chain reaction you create, the more points you score!
