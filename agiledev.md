# Agile Design Prototype

## Concept Design

### Problem Statement

In today's digital-driven society, it is no surprise that school students and working adults across the globe spend hours on their laptops daily. When taking a break from work, many often like to play online games, such as DOTA, League of Legends and Candy Crush Saga, to name a few.

However, from both observation and experience, such games are often addictive, resulting in decreasing productivity levels and prolonged procrastination.

### Solution
My goal is to create a web game that provides a quick and effective form of de-stress, while not being too addictive.

## User Stories

| User Story | Feature |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| As a stressed-out and tired student/workaholic, I want to play a game that requires minimal effort. | Player only makes 1 move per round. |
| As a busy person, I want to play a game that is fun but not too addictive. |Confine game to 5 levels to limit the time of a given playing session. |
| As a player, I want my game to be visually appealing so that I will have a more enjoyable game experience. | Integrate a colorful design for the game. |
| As a player, I want to play a game that involves an element of strategy so that I will feel challenged. | Balls will movely randomly on the screen, but player has to strategically position target to capture as many balls as possible. |
