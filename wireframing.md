My goal is to create a game for stressed students and workaholics who want to take a short break and play a web game. I aim to design the game such that it provides a quick and effective form of de-stress, while not being too addictive.

In this vein, I will confine my game to 5 levels to limit the time of a given playing session.

## User Stories

- As a player, I want my game to be visually appealing so that I will have a more enjoyable game experience.
- As a busy person, I want to play a game that is fun but not too addictive.
- As a player, I want to play a game that involves an element of strategy so that I will feel challenged.
- As a stressed-out student/workaholic, I want to play a game that requires minimal effort.

## Wireframing

Make a wireframe for each page you need to fulfill the user stories.
